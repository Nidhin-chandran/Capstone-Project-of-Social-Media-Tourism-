# Social-Media-Tourism 1- EDA (Capstone-Project)
An aviation company that provides domestic as well as international trips to the customers now  wants to apply a targeted approach instead of reaching out to each of the customers This time 
they want to do it digitally instead of tele calling. Hence they have collaborated with a social 
networking platform, so they can learn the digital and social behaviour of the customers and 
provide the digital advertisement on the user page of the targeted customers who have a high 
propensity to take up the product. 

Objective: 

 want to find the propensity of buying tickets from the different login devices. So, I have to create 2 models separately for Laptop and Mobile hence, this analysis will help the aviation company to improvise them in marking through social medias.
