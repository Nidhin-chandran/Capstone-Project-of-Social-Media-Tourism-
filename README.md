# Capstone-Project-of-Social-Media-Tourism 1- EDA 
An aviation company that provides domestic as well as international trips to the customers now  wants to apply a targeted approach instead of reaching out to each of the customers This time 
they want to do it digitally instead of tele calling. Hence they have collaborated with a social 
networking platform, so they can learn the digital and social behaviour of the customers and 
provide the digital advertisement on the user page of the targeted customers who have a high 
propensity to take up the product.
